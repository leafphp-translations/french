Modules are a new feature added in Leaf 3 which basically takes parts of Leaf and separates them into installable chunks which can be used both inside and outside of Leaf.

Modules are framework/library agnostic, which means that they'll work just about everywhere with zero config just as with Leaf itself.

Modules can be quickly installed through composer or the leaf CLI with a single command.

## Why modules?

The biggest question people ask with Leaf 3 is why we decided to switch to modules, stripping leaf of almost all it's code.

[@mychidarko](https://github.com/mychidarko) put an article together on why we decided to switch to modules instead of maintaining the whole code together. We also have a [GitHub discussion](https://github.com/leafsphp/leaf/discussions/70) introducing leaf 3 and everything you need to know about it, we explain modules further here.

## Installing modules

<!-- <VideoDocs

Modules are always published on composer and can be installed through composer CLI or the leaf CLI.

**Composer:**

```sh
composer require leafs/<module-name>
```

**Leaf CLI:**

```sh
leaf install <module-name>
```
